This is the webpage for NSF Forgetful Database project. 

# Purpose

This proposal seeks implementation-proven answers to the question: when do data expire? The proposed work is motivated by a cyber-physical transportation application
– fleets of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) driving on potentially icy roads, where safety-critical
road friction information is shared via a wireless data link to a central database that mediates data averaging.
The insight of our approach is to treat the database as a sensor to the vehicle, and the aggregation of
data within the database as a sensor-averaging process. This abstraction reveals that the database functionality
can be formally modeled to quantify the impacts of timeliness as well as uncertainty of information,
enabling analysis of the stability of the vehicle’s behavior and the stability of the vehicle/database interaction
as a function of the averaging process

# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.
>
> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
