# Purpose

This proposal seeks implementation-proven answers to the question: when do data expire? The proposed work is motivated by a cyber-physical transportation application
– fleets of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) driving on potentially icy roads, where safety-critical
road friction information is shared via a wireless data link to a central database that mediates data averaging.
The insight of our approach is to treat the database as a sensor to the vehicle, and the aggregation of
data within the database as a sensor-averaging process. This abstraction reveals that the database functionality
can be formally modeled to quantify the impacts of timeliness as well as uncertainty of information,
enabling analysis of the stability of the vehicle’s behavior and the stability of the vehicle/database interaction
as a function of the averaging process

# How it works (flow chart from NSF CPS meeting)
