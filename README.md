# Notes
+ Liming is using the index.md to generate the website because it is easire to use. We can convert the .md file into .html file using [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) or other tools.  Of cousre, we can edit a html file directly.
+ Some tips for the index.md file editing:
   1. When copy the image link at github, we need to find the image and right click on it, and then select "copy image address". Otherwise, the image can not be shown correctly at website libk. This may result from the private setting of repo. 
   2. When embed video, it is recommended to put the vidoe file at dropbox or youtube, and then use screenshoot of the video as a link. The video at github can not be played correctly. 

+ Publication list is generated based on the file F:\Forgetting by Design Dropbox\99_Reporting and Publications\PublicationList_NSF.bib. Drag this file into the Temp folder of Mendeley, and then select all of them, right click and copy as formated citation.
